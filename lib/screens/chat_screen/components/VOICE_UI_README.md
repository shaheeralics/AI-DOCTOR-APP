  },
  onSend: () {
    // Handle sending voice message
  },
  onLock: () {
    // Handle recording lock
  },
)
```

## Integration

The component is integrated with `ChatInput` and appears when the microphone button is pressed. It replaces the regular chat input during recording mode.

## Customization

- Colors use the app's medical theme (`kMedicalBlue`, `kCardBackground`)
- Fonts use the consistent `Montserrat` family
- Animation timings can be adjusted in the controller setup
- Gesture thresholds can be modified in the pan handlers

## Note

This is a UI-only component. Actual voice recording functionality should be implemented separately using packages like `record` or `audio_session`.
